"""
any-loc backend
===============
A tiny local server that lets you spoof your iPhone/iPad OR Android GPS from a
Google-Maps-style web UI. Cross-platform (Windows + macOS).

How it works:
  - The web UI streams (lat, lon) updates; we apply the latest one on an open
    channel to the device. Keeping the channel open is what makes joystick
    movement smooth (reconnecting on every call is far too slow to drive).
  - The device-specific part lives behind a LocationBackend (see backend_base.py):
      * iOS     — pymobiledevice3 tunnel + Apple DVT LocationSimulation
                  (ios_backend.py). Needs elevation for the tunnel.
      * Android — bundled adb + the system `cmd location` test-provider
                  (android_backend.py). No elevation needed.
    DeviceWorker owns everything generic (asyncio loop, state machine, the
    latest-wins mover loop) and just calls the backend for the device touchpoints.

Everything here is Python stdlib; the device backends pull in their own deps.

        Stop the session and BLOCK until the device has actually been released.

        This used to be fire-and-forget: it only did call_soon_threadsafe() and
        returned, so the interpreter exited and killed the daemon worker thread
        before the session's async `finally` ever ran. The result was a phone
        left frozen at the fake coordinate — Android's test providers were never
        removed, and iOS does not auto-clear when the DVT channel closes (its
        close() is a documented no-op). Closing the app therefore did NOT give
        you your real GPS back.

        So the contract is now: **when this returns True, the phone is back on
        real GPS.** Callers (the launcher's shutdown_all) depend on that, which
        is why they must call this FIRST, before anything else is torn down.

        clear_first — ask the session to clear the simulated location on its way
                      out (leave it True unless you deliberately want the fake
                      location to persist).
        timeout      — seconds to wait for the teardown. A real teardown takes
                       ~1.4-1.7s; the default leaves generous headroom.

        Returns False if the session did not finish in time (the caller should
        log it and carry on rather than hang forever — a wedged USB channel must
        not be able to keep the window open).

        print()/logging output is silently discarded. So the ring is not a
        nicety — it is the diagnostic channel.

        response and you get only what has appeared since. Everything is parsed
        defensively (garbage query strings must not 500 the log viewer — that is
